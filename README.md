Simple MEAN stack application

To run on your local machine, run nodemon in the backend directory and
run ng server in the frontend directory.

Project based on following video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1tRLveSyNz8, and now am expanding with features including:
- post editing and deleting
- live post feed using sockets
- app routing (so far just a "this page not found page")
- and more on the way!
